## [1.0.1] - 2024-XX-XX

### Added
- **Agent Naming System**: Personalize your AI assistant with a custom name for more natural interactions
  - Name your agent during onboarding (step 6 of 8)
  - Address your agent directly: "Hey [AgentName], make this more professional"
  - Update agent name anytime through settings
  - Smart AI processing distinguishes between commands and regular dictation
  - Clean output automatically removes agent name references
- **Draggable Interface**: Click and drag the dictation panel to any position on screen

- **Flexible Hotkey System**: Fixed hardcoded hotkey limitation - now fully respects user settings

### Changed
- **[BREAKING]** Removed click-to-record functionality to prevent conflicts with dragging
- **UI Behavior**: Recording is now exclusively controlled via hotkey (no accidental triggering)
- **Tooltip Text**: Shows "Press {your-hotkey} to speak" with actual configured hotkey
- **Cursor Styles**: Changed to grab/grabbing cursors to indicate draggable interface

### Fixed
- **Hotkey Bug**: Fixed issue where hotkey setting was stored but not actually used by global shortcut
- **Documentation**: Updated all docs to reflect current UI behavior and hotkey system
- **User Experience**: Eliminated confusion between drag and click actions

### Technical Details

  - Added centralized agent name utility (`src/utils/agentName.ts`)
  - Enhanced onboarding flow with agent naming step
  - Updated ReasoningService with context-aware AI processing
  - Added agent name settings section with comprehensive UI
  - Implemented smart prompt generation for agent-addressed vs regular text
- Added IPC handlers for dynamic hotkey updates (`update-hotkey`)
- Implemented window-level dragging using screen cursor tracking
- Added real-time hotkey loading from localStorage in main dictation component
- Updated WindowManager to support runtime hotkey changes
- Added proper drag state management with smooth 60fps window positioning
- **Code Organization**: Extracted functionality into dedicated managers and React hooks:
  - HotkeyManager, DragManager, AudioManager, MenuManager, DevServerManager
  - useAudioRecording, useWindowDrag, useHotkey React hooks
  - WindowConfig utility for centralized window configuration
  - Reduced WindowManager from 465 to 190 lines through composition pattern
